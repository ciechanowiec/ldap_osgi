This repository delivers a shaded OSGi bundle of https://github.com/apache/directory-ldap-api[_Apache Directory LDAP API_].

== Features
. Maven coordinates for the bundle delivered by this repository:

Contrary to the official https://github.com/apache/directory-ldap-api/blob/e6262ebd4fa80a3e0217d3a78161c79d2ec79c58/README.md?plain=1#L29[documentation], the above _Apache Directory LDAP API_ artifact isn't OSGi-ready. Its MANIFEST file lacks the required OSGi-specific headers, rendering the artifact unusable in an OSGi environment:

    Manifest-Version: 1.0
    Implementation-Title: Apache Directory API All
    Automatic-Module-Name: org.apache.directory.ldap.api.all
    Implementation-Version: 2.1.1
    Specification-Vendor: The Apache Software Foundation
    Specification-Title: Apache Directory API All
    Build-Jdk-Spec: 1.8
    Created-By: Maven JAR Plugin 3.2.2
    Specification-Version: 2.1
    Implementation-Vendor: The Apache Software Foundation

* The bundle delivered by this repository includes a JAR file with all source code and original Javadocs, making its usage more convenient.

* To run the bundle delivered by this repository, Java 11 or higher is required.

* All dependencies not typically present in a standard OSGi environment and required by the bundle delivered by this repository are embedded within the bundle itself, ensuring it is self-sufficient and ready to run in an OSGi environment.
